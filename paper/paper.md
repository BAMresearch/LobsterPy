# Summary
The LOBSTER software helps extract chemical bonding information from materials by post-processing the density functional theory
computational data by projecting the wave functions onto an atomic orbital basis.  _Lobsterpy_ is a Python package that provides
convenient tools to systematically analyze, describe, and visualize these LOBSTER computations results. Since its first release,
its capabilities have been extended significantly. Unlike earlier versions which could only automatically analyze Crystal Orbital
Hamilton Populations (COHPs)[@dronskowski1993crystal], LobsterPy can now also analyze crystal orbital overlap populations
(COOP)[@hughbanks1983chains] and Crystal orbital bond index (COBI)[@muÌˆller2021crystal] to extract summarized bonding
information (includes information on coordination environments, bond strengths, most relevant bonds, bonding and anti-bonding
contributions). Optionally, users can further extract the most important orbitals contributing to the relevant bonds. Additionally,
featurize and structure graphs utility sub-packages provide a pathway to engineer features to be used further for machine learning
studies. Alongside its Python interface, it also provides an easy-to-use command line interface (CLI) that runs automatic analysis
of the computations and generates a summary of results and publication-ready figures.

_Lobsterpy_ was used to produce the results in [@ngo2023dft, @morgan2023structures, @naik2023quantumchemical]

# Statement of need
Although the idea of "chemical bonding" might seem perplexing from a
physical standpoint, it has been employed several times to explain
various chemical phenomena and material properties.[@das2023strong, @ertural2022first,
@hu2023mechanism] With the recent
advances in automation frameworks for high-throughput computational
investigations, bonding analysis for thousands of crystalline materials
could be performed with few lines of code.[@george2022automated] This
automation helps reduce the common mistakes inexperienced users make
while performing bonding analysis. However, it is essential to systematically
generate inputs and post-process the output files consistently to have
reliable and reproducible results. Furthermore,
having data from high-throughput calculations ready to utilize as inputs
would benefit data-driven material science research. _Lobsterpy_ aims to fulfill
this missing link.

# Features
