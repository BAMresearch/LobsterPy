    "Below is a schematic depicting how this algorithm works. The image is from a talk given by Prof. Dr. George at [MC16 2023 Dublin](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-bam/frontdoor/index/index/start/0/rows/10/sortfield/year/sortorder/desc/searchtype/simple/query/George/author_facetfq/George%2C+Janine/doctypefq/lecture/docId/57876)  \n",

    "Unlike purely geometry-based algorithms, e.g., Voronoi construction, which depends on angle and distance cutoffs, LobsterEnv needs only one parameter that influences neighbor selection, i.e., ICOHPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when running automatic analysis using the Analysis module, `cutoff_icohp` is the parameter to be paid attention to. This value is set to 10% by default. This means that, depending on the type of bond (cation-anion or all), only ICOHPs with a value of more than 10% of the largest ICOHPs (this value also changes depending on the type of bonds considered for analysis, cation-anion/all bonds) are considered in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `noise_cutoff` parameter takes care of numerical noise, which always exists in theoretical computations. So, ICOHPs, which are negligible, will not be considered in the bonding analysis.\n",

    "LobsterPy follows following steps to evaluate the bonding and anti-bonding percentages at each symetrically independent sites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All the relevant bonds are identfied for site in the structure using ICOHPs via LobsterEnv (bond labels from `ICOHPLIST.lobster` are also stored, along with ICOHP values).\n",
    "2. Read the COHP data from `COHPCAR.lobster` corresponding to bond labels from step 1 and get summed COHPs data for each site seperately.\n",
    "3. Perform numerical integration of the summed COHPs at each site to evaluate the bonding and antibonding integral and percentages.\n",
    "4. One can also set the `start` parameter when initializing Analysis class object to set the start point of energy range below efermi for the intergration. (Optional and useful if one wants to look at specific energy range below efermi)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Ideally, the $(bonding-antibonding)$ integral values should equal to the summed ICOHP values at the each site. However, as it is a known fact, numerical integration are bound of have some error associated with it. Thus it can happen we might not see this corroborate very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to note that the ICOHP values from `ICOHPLIST.lobster` consider the entire range below efermi. Thus if the `COHPCAR.lobster` are not computed for the entire energy range below efermi, then your results will also not corroborate to summed ICOHPs at the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial factor which influences the results of the numerical integration is the number of points on which the integration is performed. Thus having a finer grid i.e setting `COHPSteps` to `2000` or in your LOBSTER run will help to get better estimates. From our experience setting `COHPSteps` to `10000` provided much consistent results. (Be mindful that the sizes of files generated from such setting can become quite large depending on the structure complexcity)\n",
