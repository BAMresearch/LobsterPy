# LobsterPy

This is a package that enables automatic plotting of Lobster outputs. You can download Lobster on [https://www.cohp.de](https://www.cohp.de).

You can pip install the package by writing "pip install -e ." in the main package. It will then use setup.py to install the package. Then, you can use "lobsterpy ..." to plot and analyze the results automatically.


Furthermore, we have some examples included where one can use Python scripts to arrive at results.
