# LobsterPy

This is a package that enables automatic plotting of Lobster outputs. You can download Lobster on [https://www.cohp.de](https://www.cohp.de).

You can pip install the package by writing "pip install -e ." in the main package. It will then use setup.py to install the package. Then, you can use "lobsterpy description" for an automated analysis or "lobsterpy automaticplot" to plot the results automatically. You can get help with that by typing "lobsterpy --help". There are further options implemented.


Furthermore, we have some examples included where one can use Python scripts to arrive at results.
